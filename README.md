This project was extremely fun! TheOdinProject gave some minor specifications, but besides that, I built this project from scratch. I approached this project by chunking up the problems. This allowed me to quickly overcome errors and not get overwhelmed by a seemingly large task. Instead, I focused on completing the mini-tasks, which gave me confidence and allowed me to understand the project more, maintain my motivation, and actually helped me to finish the project faster than I thought. This project focused on files and serialization. The game allows users to choose whether to play a new game, or continue a previous one (assuming they have created at least one game). If the user stops the game at any point, the program reads the pertinent data into a YAML file using the corresponding YAML gem. When the user selects a previous game, the program loads this data back into itself, allowing the user to continue where they left off.
